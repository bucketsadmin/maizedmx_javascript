# MAIZE DMX Lighting Control #

This is a basic JavaScript file that is used to control MIDI inputs via the [MaizeDMX](https://www.maizesoft.com/dmx/) application.

The Documentation for how to get the MIDI section working is literally
```commandline
Do you have a MIDI controller with fader and buttons? If so, great! You can support it by writing some javascript :)
In the controllers section of the settings tab, you can add any number of controller and
write or paste the supporting javascript in the code editor below.
```

Which is not helpful, there was an example provided in the doc, but it also wasn't super helpful.

So I wrote a basic script that allows for inputs from another application to go to the next cue in MaizeDMX.
